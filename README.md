# Overview of the Project

# Project : ANALYSIS ON MOVIE REVIEWS

## Objective: 
The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews using the IMDB dataset. The objective is to classify reviews as positive or negative and evaluate the performance of various classification models. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, and performance evaluation to provide insights into sentiment trends.
## Key Activities:

**Dataset Collection:**
Acquired the IMDB dataset from Kaggle, which includes movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.\
**Data Preprocessing:**
Cleaned the dataset by addressing imbalances between positive and negative reviews. Applied techniques such as random undersampling to balance the dataset and performed text preprocessing to prepare the data for analysis.\
**Splitting the Dataset:**
Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to build and evaluate the models. This split helps in assessing the model's performance on unseen data.\
**Feature Extraction:**
Utilized TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms. This step involved transforming the review texts into a matrix of TF-IDF features.\
**Building the Model:**
Implemented and trained several classification models, including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. Each model was trained on the TF-IDF features of the training set.\
**Model Evaluation:**
Assessed the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix. This step involved comparing the effectiveness of different models in classifying reviews correctly.\
**Fine-tuning the Model:**
Optimized the SVC model by performing grid search to find the best hyperparameters. This step involved experimenting with different values of regularization parameter and kernel types to improve model accuracy.\
**Deployment and Prediction:**
The final model was used to predict the sentiment of new movie reviews, allowing for real-time sentiment classification.
